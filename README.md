This project analyzes survey data from 630 respondents to uncover trends in the data professional industry.
Using Power BI, I processed, cleaned, and visualized the data to explore insights related to job roles, salaries, industry challenges, and programming language preferences. 
The data cleaning process involved removing irrelevant columns, standardizing "Other" responses,
and converting salary ranges into numerical values using Power Query. This ensured the data was structured properly for analysis and visualization.

I created an interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers for dynamic filtering, allowing users to explore key trends efficiently. 
The dashboard includes multiple visualizations, such as a treemap showing the country of survey takers, 
a stacked bar chart displaying the average salary by job title, a stacked column chart illustrating the favorite programming language,
and a donut chart highlighting the difficulty in breaking into the data industry. Additionally, I used gauge charts to represent happiness with salary and work-life balance, 
while cards display the count of survey takers and their average age.

These visualizations provide valuable insights into the data professional industry. The survey results indicate that Python is the most preferred programming language,  
The analysis also reveals that data analysts make up the largest portion of survey respondents, reflecting the high demand for this role in the industry.

For future improvements, I plan to integrate real-time data updates, add more interactive filters, and enhance data storytelling using advanced DAX calculations. 
This project has strengthened my skills in data analytics, visualization, and business intelligence, offering a deeper understanding of industry trends. 
Contributions and suggestions for improvement are always welcome through forking the repository and submitting pull requests.
